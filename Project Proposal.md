# UP 206A Project Proposal - Aziz Fellague and Andrew Jarnagin (Winter 2021)
# Analyzing Bus Rapid Transit Service Corridors in Los Angeles and Atlanta
## Research Question
We plan to study existing and proposed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) routes in Los Angeles and Atlanta. Within a .25 mile walkshed of stops along the route, we will calculate residential and employment density and the demographics of residents. With this information, we can evaluate the feasibility of these routes as compared to recommended densities for the BRT mode and the extent to which these routes serve disadvantaged communities.

## Project Detail
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) offers improved speed and reliability over traditional bus service at a significantly lower start-up cost and shorter construction timeline than rail. As governments from the federal to local level seek to reduce pollution from automobile use and address urban traffic congestion, transit agencies across the U.S. are exploring BRT as a quick and cost-efficient method to improve the public transit experience for riders. Transit agencies often neglect bus riders, and implementing BRT is one way to redress this imbalance of investment. BRT also offers a “premium” transit service in areas not considered sufficiently dense for rail. 

We will be looking at existing and proposed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines in Los Angeles and Atlanta and compare accessibility to the BRT stations. BRT in the United States is a relatively new concept and to examine the effectiveness of BRT, we would like to examine how easy it is to get to the BRT stations in walking distance (0.25 miles). We will be using an isochrome walkshed for the most accurate representation of walking distance. 

Los Angeles and Atlanta share many characteristics from urban form to transportation culture: both cities are overwhelmingly car-centric, have relatively low density for urban areas, experience severe traffic congestion, and are making ballot-supported investments to improve and expand public transit service.

Bus Rapid Transit can be an effective tool in promoting economic justice and eliminating poverty. By looking at the walking distance to each BRT station along with census data showing race, income, and density, we can see whether Metro is effectively serving its riders (who are predominantly Black and Latinx) through BRT. Looking at MARTA’s proposed BRT line, we will be performing a similar analysis. 

Visualization?

For proposed BRT routes, we can measure density along the route to make initial predictions about whether the density is likely to support ridership goals. For all BRT routes studied, we should be able to draw conclusions about the neighborhoods served and whether these match with the transit agencies’ stated priorities.
