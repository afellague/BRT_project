*Title:* Census Tracts in Los Angeles County and Metro Atlanta 

We are planning on finding census tracts in LA County and Metro Atlanta by race and income in order to inform us whether current or proposed Bus Rapid Transit 
systems are serving Black and brown communities as well as lower-income communities. The data that Aziz has compiled is from LA County, and the data that Andrew has 
compiled is from the counties in and around Atlanta.
